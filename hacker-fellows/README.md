# Hacker Fellows 2016 Post Mortem

## Things That Could Improve

#### Timeline

* What days we have off (4th of July) and how to talk about needed days off

* What amount of money we get (including subtractions for meal plan), when we get it.

  * I found the infographic helpful, but I think the dates could have been clearer and descriptions of which money goes to whom (us/company)

  * Explain how HF subsidizes our salary to the startup

* Hiring timeline:
  
  * how long after interview day offers will come (last time there was a slot for "offers extended")

  * how long after bootcamp you will usually start working (you work out a start date with your company)

#### Bootcamp expectations

* (Once accepted) - Mediums to contact HackerFellows alumni

* Sample of an example class format (maybe a fake weekly schedule posted)

* Description of what and where each building is (Grand Circus and Invest Detroit) and on what occasions we will be at either building

## Things That Went Really Well

#### Communication

* Communication/answering questions on short notice

* Email updates were thorough

## New Ideas for 2017

* Pictures of bootcamp/classroom/company prospects posted
