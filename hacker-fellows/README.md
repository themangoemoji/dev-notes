# Hacker Fellows 2016 Retrospective

## Things That Could Improve/Be More Clear

#### Timeline

* What days we have off (4th of July) and how to talk about needed days off

* What amount of money we get (including subtractions for meal plan), when we get it.

  * I found the infographic helpful, but I think the dates could have been clearer and descriptions of which money goes to whom (us/company)

  * Explain how HF subsidizes our salary to the startup

* Hiring timeline:

  * how long after interview day offers will come (last time there was a slot for "offers extended")

  * how long after bootcamp you will usually start working (you work out a start date with your company)

#### Bootcamp expectations

* Wayne State living expectations (kitchens/rooms)
  
  * This might seem trivial, but knowing the kitchen/living situation far ahead of time would have helped me plan my moving

* Description of what and where each building is (Grand Circus and Invest Detroit) and on what occasions we will be at either building

* Laptop required, means to work in unix env

* Clearly define - what are Sam's and Brad's roles? To whom do we go and for what?

#### Tools

* Slack is great, but wasn't very well explained (how do you expect us to contribute? What's important/appropriate/how to navigate the channels)

## Things That Went Really Well

* Generally Everything

#### Communication

* Questions on short notice were answered really well

#### Tools

* HF Portal was easy to use and made sense

* Email updates were thorough

* Notebooks were a great starting gift/swag

* Google surveys were easy and well designed

## New Ideas for 2017

* Pictures of bootcamp/classroom/company prospects posted on site

* Do's and Don'ts from previous fellows

* Study-ahead material (github, css/html)

* (Once accepted) - Mediums to contact HackerFellows alumni

* Sample of an example class format (maybe a fake weekly schedule posted)
